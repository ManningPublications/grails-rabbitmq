    The plugin provides a convention based mechanism for associating a listener with a queue. Any Grails Service may express that it wants to receive messages on a specific queue by defining a static property named <code>rabbitQueue</code> and
assigning the property a string which represents the name of a queue.<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre><span class="java&#45;keyword">package</span> org.grails.rabbitmq.test<p class="paragraph"/>class DemoService &#123;
    <span class="java&#45;keyword">static</span> rabbitQueue = 'someQueueName'<p class="paragraph"/>    void handleMessage(message) &#123;
        // handle message&#8230;
    &#125;
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>As with the pub/sub model, messages are delivered to the service by invoking the <code>handleMessage()</code> method. That's all there is to it! The real trick is to configure your exchanges and queues with appropriate bindings, as we described in the configuration section.<p class="paragraph"/>One last subject to discuss is the form that the messages take.
